### Projet 5 - Construisez*un_site* e_commerce_en_JavaScript

This is the front end and back end server for Project 5 of the Web Developer path.

### Back end Prerequisites

You will need to have Node and `npm` installed locally on your machine (`npm install`).

### Back end Installation

From the "back" folder of the project, run the server with `node server` command.
Then server should run on `localhost` with default port `3000`. If the
server runs on another port for any reason, this is printed to the
console when the server starts, e.g. `Listening on port 3001`.
